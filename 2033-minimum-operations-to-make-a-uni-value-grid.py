Description:
You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one
operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.

A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.

Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is
not possible, return -1.
