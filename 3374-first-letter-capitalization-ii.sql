Description:
Write a solution to transform the text in the content_text column by applying
the following rules:
 * Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase and the remaining
   letters to lowercase
 * Special handling for words containing special characters:
   * For words connected with a hyphen -, both parts should be capitalized
     (e.g., top-rated â†’ Top-Rated)
   * All other formatting and spacing should remain unchanged

Return the result table that includes both the original content_text and the
modified text following the above rules.
