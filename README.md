# Leetcode solutions  
## Solutions that I have written to Leetcode problems.  
 I initially started bashing `ctrl + enter` after passing the initial tests
 without taking my acceptance rate into account (I think one or two of the
 daily problems really dragged my rate down). I quickly started taking "add
 test case" into account and more careful use of  `ctrl + '` run into
 account and am trying to get my rate up above 66%. I always make an attempt at
 solving the challenge, generally if I spend a few hours and get a TLE I'll
 consult a resource such as Neetcode, but I always make sure that I try to
 understand the gap between my suboptimal solution and the optimal one that
 I end up submitting. This repo is a reflection of my learning journey.
