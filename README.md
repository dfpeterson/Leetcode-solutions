# Leetcode solutions  
## Solutions that I have written to Leetcode problems.  
 I initially started bashing `ctrl + enter` after passing the intial tests 
 without taking my acceptance rate into account (I think one or two of the
 daily problems really dragged my rate down). I quickly started taking "add
 test case" into account and more careful use of  `ctrl + '` run into
 account and am trying to get my rate up above 66%.
